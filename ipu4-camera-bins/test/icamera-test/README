User Guide

1.Introduction
This test framework consists of Command tests(written by Shell) and API tests(written by C++)

  a) Command tests
    All pipeline commands are generated by templates from gst_case_common.sh
    Test cases are classified as follows:

      1.Basic capabilities check
        Verify properties, caps info .etc

        script:
              gst_inspect_attrs.sh

      2.Check dumped image files
        Dump both progressive/interlaced image files, check return values and image info

        script:
              gst_luanch_dump_image_progressive_interlace.sh

      3.Check dumped image files under abnormal circumstances
        The pipeline will be configured with incorrect parameters,expected to return error message

        script:
              gst_launch_dump_image_false_params.sh

      4.Preview user buffers
        Display with progressive/interlaced UserPtr buffers, check return values or average fps

        script:
              gst_launch_preview_progressive_interlace.sh

      5.Preview DMA buffers
        Display with DMA buffers, check return values

        Script:
              gst_launch_preview_dma_buffer.sh

      6.KPI tests
        Preview with KPI configures, check return values

        Script:
              gst_launch_preview_kpi.sh

  b)API tests
    All test cases are based on gtest framework, each case is linked by Gstreamer API

2.How to run test cases
  There are several options to choose in camerasrc_test.sh

  #List all the cases available on each platform
  ./camerasrc_test.sh -l

  #Run all the cases automatically
  ./camerasrc_test.sh -a

  #Execute single case
  ./camerasrc_test.sh -f (case index)

  #Execute cases with certain pattern
  ./camerasrc_test.sh -p contain|except (case index)

  #Select specific sensor to run corresponding tests(need gst-tool)
  ./camerasrc_test.sh -t
